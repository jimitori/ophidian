Ophidian is a constructed language created for communication between humans and snakes in magical universes.

## Lore of the Language
Ophidian serves as a bridge for communication between humans and snakes. It was magically created by humans, as snakes themselves don’t need it, relying primarily on non-verbal communication.

On one hand, Ophidian reflects the unique perception of the world by snakes and includes a significant layer of native snake vocabulary (for example, the word to hiss was borrowed from the snake language into human languages). On the other hand, many words in Ophidian are borrowed from human languages, especially when it comes to concepts unfamiliar or uninteresting to snakes.
