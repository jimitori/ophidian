## original text
The old snake was dying. He lay coiled beneath the roots of an acacia tree, his scales dry, his breath slow. The young ones came to him, their tongues flicking, their bodies restless.

"Tell us the story again," one of them said. "The first story."

The old snake blinked. He had told it before, many times, but they always wanted to hear it. He did not mind.

"In the beginning," he said, "we were the rivers. We moved as the water moves, winding through the land, carrying life where we passed. The people worshipped us then. They carved our shapes into the rock, painted us on their walls, called us wise."

The young snakes nodded. They had seen the carvings, the paintings. But the people no longer bowed when they passed.

"Then came the fire," the old snake continued. "Not the fire of the sun, not the fire that warms. This was a fire of men. They burned the land and burned their stories and made new ones without us in them."

The young ones hissed. They knew these stories, too.

"But we are not gone," the old snake said. "We move still. In the dark, in the quiet. In the rivers that men do not see. The wise still come. The fools still fear. We wait. We remember."

His breath rattled, then stopped. The young ones watched him, then slowly unwound from the roots of the tree. They slid away, silent, moving like rivers through the land.
