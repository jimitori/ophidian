# verb grammar

# verbs have two types:
# 1. -ss- type: active verbs
# 2. -xx- type: stative verbs
# Type 1 verbs retain their basic stem in all forms, while type 2 verbs have a geminated stem in some forms.
# Geminated stem is a form of the stem, when the first C and the last V are doubled, while the -xx- affix is dropped.
